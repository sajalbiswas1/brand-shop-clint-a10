# five features
- **Database**
  - Databases provide a reliable way to store data for the long term. Data is stored on non-volatile storage devices, ensuring that it is not lost when the system is powered off or restarted
- **MongoDB**
  - MongoDB uses a flexible schema model, which means you can store data in the database without the need to define its structure beforehand. This flexibility is particularly useful when dealing with evolving data models or when working with semi-structured or unstructured data.
- **Server**
  - Server-side scripting allows you to generate dynamic content based on user interactions, data from databases, or external sources. This enables you to create interactive and personalized websites.
  - With server-side scripting, you can easily connect your website to a database, which is essential for storing and managing data such as user profiles, content, and transaction history.
- **Dynamic Rating**
  - Dynamic ratings can make your website or application more interactive and engaging. Users enjoy providing feedback and seeing their input reflected visually.
- **Firebase**
  - Firebase Authentication provides secure user authentication mechanisms, including email/password, phone number, and social media logins. It helps protect user accounts and sensitive information.
